1. The deployment Selector labels must match with the Service selector labels:
    matchLabels:
      app: guestbook-web
      tier: frontend
    Instead of guestbook value in app key-value pair

    As well as the template labels, as both are use to establish a connection between the deployment and the service:
     template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: guestbook-web
        tier: frontend
2. Services should not contain labels
3. wrong order of server configuration file: selector data should be above Ports
4. Service Target Port must be the same as the container port (target port has been set as por 80 by default):
      ports:
        - port: 80
        - targetPort: 8080
5. By convention, I would change  the deployment Name to frontend-deployment and the service to frontend-service
6.  Double quotes for the environment variable value:
          env:
        - name: GET_HOSTS_FROM
          value: "dns"
